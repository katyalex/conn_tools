# conn_tools

Some tools born from practical needs during the analysis of ROI-to-ROI functional connectivity using the excellent [CONN Toolbox](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/conn). 

## 1) Extract and plot brain networks connectivity matrix

Automatize the extraction and plotting of brain networks connectivity matrix from CONN results folder, using either Matlab or Python

### Scripts:
Matlab:
	- extract_correl_mat.m
	- plot_correl_mat.matrix
Python
	- conn_correl_mat.py

## 2) Plot BOLD denoised timeseries of a pair of ROIs and compute the correlation coefficient

### Script: 
	-conn_plot_ts.m
